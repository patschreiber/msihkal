Mac Software I Have Known And Loved.

## Categories

### Music

#### Meta

The problem with iTunes is that it's very opinionated and tries to move your files around. You also can't feed it multiple sources, and the final nail in the coffin was that I didn't see a spot to save the "Key" of the song, which is killer for me since I want a long-lasting library I can use for music production/DJing.

Cost (at time of writing): 
* Trial mode
* $20 per license

#### Loopback

"Cable-free audio routing for your Mac"\n
What's great about Loopback is you can turn any sound emitting program into an audio interface that a DAW can pick up. Just set up an audio interface for Loopback, then set the input device in your DAW to be that Loopback.

Some ideas:
* Find a piece of audio on YouTube you want to sample?
* Want to pipe Spotify directly into your DAW?
* Want to route your DJ controller audio into Ableton to post process a DJ set? 
* Want to easily capture a sample of TextEdit's "text-to-speech" voice?

Cost (at time of writing): 
* Permissive trial mode (Seriously, it feels like old-school WinRAR nagware)
* $99 per license
